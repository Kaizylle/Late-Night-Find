            <p>The one that couldn't let go - story of my life. If I die before the age of 43, I hope to at least release new music before 30, experience real love by 26, and have a stable life before the end of 2025. I hate my struggles and challenges, yet I can still enjoy the good things in life - my friends - for the most part - my family, who I've had countless falling outs with. But pain is supposed to fester into something better, something great. Then why am I still hurting? I am I still under the surface? Why can't I elevate? It's too bad - all this frustation and anguish is gonna shoot pass the surface, like athe Magic Giant Bean, I'm going to grow so big, it'd' going to be overwhelming. I just to grow, nothing else, just keep growing toward something greater than I've ever got to experience.
            </p>
            <p>New and first album, new style, new and first film, new content, new me, new answers, new challenges, new car, new living situation, new, new, new, new love I never experience. I jsut want new. I am tired of being the pushover in life. for dickheads to step on me and elevate unhumbly. I hate niggas, I hate bitches, and I especially hate these new nigga bitches around here. I'm skewing off the topic, but there really wasn't any topic. Just my thoughts and concerns. New music before 2026. Please universe, help me work something out.</p>
